Normally you would just do an estimate and add enough slack, so you are sure that there is no journeys that falls outside this window. The parameter is used find all possible dates for the journey and then search only the services which run on those dates. The duration must include access, egress, wait-time and transit time for the whole journey. It should also take low frequency days/periods like holidays into account. In other words, pick the two points within your area that has the worst connection and then try to travel on the worst possible day, and find the maximum journey duration. Using a value that is too high has the effect of including more patterns in the search, hence, making it a bit slower. Recommended values would be from 12 hours(small town/city), 1 day (region) to 2 days (country like Norway). | *Optional* | `"PT24H"`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |   na  |

A  stopBoardAlightCosts is added to the generalized-cost during routing. But this cost cannot be too high, because that would add extra cost to the transfer, and favor other alternative paths. But, when optimizing transfers, we do not have to take other paths into consideration and can "boost" the stop-priority-cost to allow transfers to take place at a preferred stop. The cost added during routing is already added to the generalized-cost used as a base in the optimized transfer calculation. By setting this parameter to 0, no extra cost is added, by setting it to {@code 1.0} the stop-cost is doubled. Stop priority is only supported by the NeTEx import, not GTFS.                                                                                                                                                                                 | *Optional* | `0.0`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   na  |
