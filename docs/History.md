# OpenTripPlanner Project History

OpenTripPlanner was seeded with a [Regional Travel Options grant](http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=21470) and opened with a [3-day Kick-Off Workshop](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/kick-off-workshop) in July of 2009 in which several transit agencies and key developers met to initiate the project and set the roadmap to meet for the minimum grant requirements.

A two-year meeting was held to mark the end of the first phase in 2011.
