# OpenTripPlanner Project History

OpenTripPlanner was seeded with a [Regional Travel Options grant](http://www.oregonmetro.gov/index.cfm/go/by.web/id=21470) and opened with a [3-day Kick-Off Workshop](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/kick-off-workshop) in July of 2009 in which several transit agencies and key developers met to initiate the project and set the roadmap to meet for the minimum grant requirements.

A two-year meeting was held to mark the end of the first phase in 2011.
TriMet's 2009-2011 [OTP Final Report](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/Reports/OTP%20Final%20Report%20-%20Metro%202009-2011%20RTO%20Grant.pdf).

We would like to thank [everyone who attended](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/WorkingGroup) the [Kick-off Workshop](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/kick-off-workshop) and contributed to the project thus far.

 * Brandon Martin-Anderson, who ported core pieces of Graphserver from C to Java to kickstart the project.

 * Brian Ferris, creator of OneBusAway, has contributed extensively, architecting the project's graph-building process, to name but one of his many contributions (the project also benefits from the fantastic GTFS library Brian develops and maintains). 

 * Frank Purcell of TriMet contributed the basis for our user interface and API. 

 * David Emory has shared his knowledge and code from Five Points and is working on some truly exciting biking features, including elevation visualizations.

 * David Turner has built core pieces of the routing engine, contributing everything from narrative generation to accessibility support.
