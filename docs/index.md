## OpenTripPlanner
_Note: this documentation is targeted primarily at the OTP development community and more technical users. For high-level information about the project, please visit [**opentripplanner.org**](http://www.opentripplanner.org)_

**OpenTripPlanner** (OTP) is an open source multi-modal trip planner, which runs on Linux, Mac, Windows, or potentially any platform with a Java virtual machine. OTP is released under the [LGPL license](https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0). The code is under active development with a variety of [deployments](Deployments) around the world.

If you want to get started right away running your own OTP instance, the best place to start is the [Basic Usage](Basic-Usage) page.

**Latest Project Updates**

 * **Version 1.2 was released on 18 August 2017.**

 * After seven years of hard work and almost 10,000 commits from over 100 contributors around the world, **version 1.0 was released on 9 September 2016**!
 
 * The Helsinki Regional Transport Authority (HSL) [trip planner](https://digitransit.fi/en/) based on OpenTripPlanner is in public beta as of spring 2016. Source code for their new UI is [available on Github](https://github.com/HSLdevcom/digitransit-ui).

 * As of 2015, OTP powers the New York State department of transportation's [transit trip planner](http://511ny.org/tripplanner/default.aspx).
   It provides itineraries for public transit systems throughout the state in a single unified OTP instance.

 * In November of 2014, Arlington, Virginia launched a new [commute planning site](http://mobilitylab.org/2014/11/07/the-who-what-when-where-whys-of-carfreeatoz/) for the Washington, DC metropolitan area.
 It depends on OpenTripPlanner to weigh the costs and benefits of various travel options, making use of [profile routing](http://conveyal.com/blog/2015/02/24/what-is-profile-routing).

 * OpenTripPlanner was a focal point in the Dutch Transport Ministry's MMRI (MultiModal Travel Information) project which encouraged investment in trip planning platforms and services. A consortium of five companies worked together to improve OpenTripPlanner performance in large regional transport networks and account for real-time service modifications and delays. The resulting [Plannerstack Foundation](http://www.plannerstack.org/)
 is now providing OpenTripPlanner and [Bliksem RRRR](https://github.com/bliksemlabs/rrrr) as hosted services including high quality open data integration for the Netherlands.

 * OpenTripPlanner has become <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy's</a> thirty-first member project. Conservancy is a non-profit public charity that provides a range of financial and administrative services to member projects that develop Free, Libre, and Open Source Software. By joining Conservancy, OpenTripPlanner obtains the benefits of a formal non-profit organizational structure while keeping the project focused on software development and documentation.

 * TriMet relaunched Portland Oregon's [official trip planner](http://ride.trimet.org) which is now powered by OTP. Read [more about the project](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/Portland-Regional-Trip-Planner), and see also TriMet's 2009-2011 [OTP Final Report](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/Reports/OTP%20Final%20Report%20-%20Metro%202009-2011%20RTO%20Grant.pdf).
