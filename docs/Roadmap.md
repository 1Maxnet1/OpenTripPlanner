The OTP community uses a GitHub-hosted Roadmap to document all long-term feature requests for OpenTripPlanner. Unlike the typical [OTP Issues](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner/issues), the issues presented in the Roadmap outline the quarterly/yearly product-focused goals that the community intends to propose for OTP, as opposed to addressing short-term bugs or feature requests.

Any individual or organization can create an Issue on the OTP Roadmap using the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [OpenTripPlanner GitHub](https://github.com/opentripplanner/OpenTripPlanner).
2. Select the "Projects" tab.
